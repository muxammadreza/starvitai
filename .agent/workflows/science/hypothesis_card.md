description: Create a research hypothesis card (evolutionary + metabolic lens)
---

## Goal
Produce a hypothesis that is testable in data and interpretable clinically.

## Card template
- Hypothesis (one sentence)
- Evolutionary rationale (mismatch / antagonistic pleiotropy / trade-off)
- Mechanism sketch (pathways, mediators)
- Operationalization:
  - cohort definition
  - variables/features
  - confounders
  - expected effect direction
- Falsification criteria
- Next experiment (graph query + statistical test)

## Output
A markdown hypothesis card in `docs/research/hypotheses/`.
