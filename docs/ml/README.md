# ML/AI layer — Starvit

Starvit’s ML runs in the **de-identified research zone** and must remain audit-ready.

Primary jobs:
- Feature engineering (BigQuery + graph-derived features)
- Training + evaluation (Vertex AI Pipelines + Experiments)
- Model registry and controlled serving (approval-required outputs)
- Novelty discovery (hypothesis queue) with safeguards
